# UI_DigitalNumberRecognition

The Recognition algorithm is learning by the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
All images or videos were done by two pre-processing, wihch are image resize to 28*28 and Binarization.
The structure of CNN is input→6c(Sigmoid)→2s→12c(Sigmoid)→2s→connection(Sigmoid)→output
